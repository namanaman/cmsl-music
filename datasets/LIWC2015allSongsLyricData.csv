Take It Back,Ed Sheeran,"I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know You'll find me ripping the writings out of the pages they sit in I never want to get bitten cause plagiarism is hidden Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen The studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather I'll do my own thing now and get respect after And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter For four years I never had a place to stay But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked And went from sleeping at a subway station to Sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love Oh I take it back with the rhythm and blues With my rap pack I'll be singing the news Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot But then again that's what they're supposed to do And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm Whispering ""everything that happens is from now on"" I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong But then I've never had an enemy except the NME But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be With all these spectacles ahead of me and festival fees Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic I'm battling for respect, I don't know if I'll have it This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love Oh Now I don't ever wanna be perfect Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written Now absence can make your heart ache but drinking Absinthe Can change your mind state vividly, need to let my liver be And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me And I hope to see him blowing up globally Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams But, but I just write schemes, I'm never having A stylist giving me tight jeans Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made And every single second knowing that we'll never betray The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love Oh Mmm, come on and take it back, love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back, love Oh My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie? With this you must know that the numbers just sold Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me We forget ninety percent of it when we wake But the other ten percent, it never fades Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss And most of these other guys are kids that pose His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow IGH!",0,988,42.97,50.81,82.55,54.35,329.33,10.02,88.16,57.59,18.42,11.94,7.19,1.21,2.83,0.40,0.30,6.48,7.79,13.26,10.43,6.68,5.87,2.63,21.05,2.83,2.02,1.11,0.81,1.42,4.45,2.94,1.42,0.20,0.40,0.20,8.50,0.20,0.40,0.10,0.71,10.83,1.92,1.72,1.42,1.82,2.43,2.43,3.04,0.81,1.52,0.51,3.54,1.52,0.71,0.00,0.40,8.30,2.53,1.62,1.72,2.94,0.51,2.94,14.57,3.24,16.90,2.53,8.30,8.00,1.21,2.13,0.40,0.40,0.10,0.00,1.62,0.10,0.20,0.10,0.91,0.00,12.04,0.00,5.26,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.10,0.40,0.20,5.87,0.00,0.00
Junkyard,Zac Brown Band,"I have lived in a junkyard Where the weeds eat up the rain If you get anything there out of place You know there's hell to pay And he said, ""You're as sick as you are lovely And in need of a hand.""

He tells her, ""You are never worthy."" She was all alone, you see?

Eraser,Ed Sheeran,"I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine I forget when I get awards now, the wave I had to ride The paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride And when the world's against me is when I really come alive And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride You know that I've got whisky with white lines, and smoke in my lungs I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree To be caught up in the trappings of the industry Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key And you'll see I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me But with that said give me one more Another one to take the sting away I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become Conversations with my father on the A14 Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans Wembley Stadium crowd's two-hundred-and-forty-thou' I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now Somehow I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me But with that said give me one more Another one to take the sting away Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser Click here for lyrics to the Extended F64 Version Welcome to the new show I guess you know I've been away But where I'm heading, who knows?

Niggas don't know how to act in a drought See, baby girl, I realized My definition of a real nigga was skewed My views misshaped by new mixtapes That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops And the cyclical nature of doing time continues My worst fear is one day that you come home from school And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true But maybe there's a chance that it's not And this album remains locked In a hard drive like valuable jewels And I can teach you this in person Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you For your eyes only For your eyes, for your eyes only For your eyes, for your eyes only For your eyes, do you understand? For your eyes only One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice And it was chilling, he said: ""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children I never asked for nothing, when times was hard I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me I dealt with the repercussions of my actions I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit But that shit was in my blood, you know my life I know your momma, nigga, send my love In case I never get a chance to speak again I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib That's the way I wished my family lived But my granny crib was in the 'jects"" I had to interject like: ""Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"" He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions But I been having premonitions Just call it visions from the other side I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow Like the time I'm living on is borrowed With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father Write my story down, and if I pass Go play it for my daughter when she ready"" And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son I dedicate these words to you and all the other children Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation That sent your pops to prison when he needed education Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better Although I know that means that I would never Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro With 'lil Zach and Cole World, barely one years old Now it's thirty years later, making sure this story's told Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold Not because he was the first To get some pussy twelve years old Not because he used to come through In the Caddy on some vogues Not because he went from bagging up Them grams to serving O's Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law"" Although that was true Your daddy was a real nigga cause he loved you For your eyes only",0,1450,30.29,69.76,67.50,19.59,69.05,11.52,91.38,57.59,22.48,17.10,7.86,0.21,6.62,2.00,0.41,5.38,5.59,11.59,9.10,5.31,5.17,2.83,21.59,3.03,1.72,1.17,1.10,0.90,4.28,1.93,2.34,0.34,0.90,0.55,14.14,1.72,0.07,1.38,2.34,12.07,3.59,1.93,1.59,2.28,1.31,3.31,5.24,3.31,0.97,0.97,5.38,3.03,1.24,0.34,0.48,5.17,0.97,0.83,2.48,1.10,0.34,5.72,11.59,1.17,12.55,2.21,5.66,5.17,1.17,1.24,0.34,0.48,0.62,0.41,2.41,1.79,0.48,0.07,0.00,0.00,12.97,0.00,5.72,0.21,0.00,1.38,0.00,0.14,0.97,4.55,0.00,0.00

I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust.
