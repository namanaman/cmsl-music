Unfaithful,Rihanna," Story of my life Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong Really loves my company He's more than a man, and this is more than love The reason that the sky is blue The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again And to him I just can't be true  And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful And it kills him inside To know that I am happy with some other guy I can see him dying  I don't wanna do this anymore I don't wanna be the reason why Everytime I walk out the door I see him die a little more inside I don't wanna hurt him anymore I don't wanna take away his life I don't wanna be a murderer  I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair Preparing for another date A kiss upon my cheek As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls A lie I didn't have to tell Because we both know where I'm about to go And we know it very well  And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful And it kills him inside To know that I am happy with some other guy I can see him dying  I don't wanna do this anymore I don't wanna be the reason why Everytime I walk out the door I see him die a little more inside I don't wanna hurt him anymore I don't wanna take away his life I don't wanna be a murderer  Our love, his trust I might as well take a gun and put it to his head Get it over with I don't wanna do this anymore, woah Anymore  I don't wanna do this anymore I don't wanna be the reason why Everytime I walk out the door I see him die a little more inside I don't wanna hurt him anymore I don't wanna take away his life I don't wanna be a murderer",y
